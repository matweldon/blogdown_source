# Regional automatic stabilisers

Tom Forth writes that it is unfair that the South East contributes more than its fair share
to public services. It's an important point.
Regional inequality affects all developed nations to some extent, and in most places the problem
is getting worse.
But at the same time he invokes the notion of solidarity:
if the South East did not pay more than it's fair share towards
the nation's public services an important part
of the pact that holds the country together would
be broken. So what is regional justice?
How does regional inequality arise?

* through agglomeration, partly, but that
doesn't explain how large cities in other parts of
the country don't reap agglomeration benefits
* Through political capture by south East interelts-
possibly would explain transport
* Through immigration t sorting of highly-motivated,
talented people.
* Skill-biased technical change means that the South suffers from high cost of
living, unaffordable housing, insufficient public
sector wages. The North sufters from lack of investment,
public sector crowding out private sector, thin labour
markets, lack of human capital, bad transport
links, insufficient inward migration.
It's possible to spend the same percapita on
the South t the North, but for the money
to do very different things that balance the
economies out. To decide whether an are a needs
a sedative or a shot of adrenalin, it's sufficient to
look at the cost of living, although private sector
incomes would be a more respensive source.
The fashionable view 15 years ago was that
regeneration was futile, & that regions falling
behind should just be "looked after" An
example of this view was henrig's paper. But
this was the opposite of what needed to
be done. This view stemmed from the
belief that agglomeration was desting.
The idea that an area that is "doing well"
would need a sedative is not easily squared
with the standard phobia of ever consciously holding
back growth. But if sorting t agglomeration
go too far they can actually hamper growth,
by mixing too much HK with am inadequate
amount of land. 

All this topic feels like it almost grasps at
really important issues around regional justice
on a global scale, & sustainability, sorting 
growth.
When is it ever good to apply a sedative to growth in
one place, to encourage growth in another?
