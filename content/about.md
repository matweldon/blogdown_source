title: About Mat
---

I'm a Senior Data Scientist, working on Privacy Enhancing Technologies at the
[Data Science Campus](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk) 
([profile](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/author/mat-weldon)) 
of the UK [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/).
Prior to joining the ONS, I worked at the Department for Education as an Economic Adviser.

Before joining the civil service, 
I completed a PhD in statistics and conducted research in the economics of education at the University of Lancaster.
Before that, I worked for several years in administrative jobs in the private and public sectors.

I live in Morecambe with my family.

### Civil service code

As a civil servant, I take my responsibilities to comply with the
[Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code) 
seriously.
I endeavour not to express any opinions that would bring my integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality into doubt.
However, as a junior civil servant in a non-policy role, I give myself more leeway to express
measured views than I would if I were in a more policy-sensitive role in the heart of government.

I hope that writing down my analysis of broad topics in public policy
(but steering clear of specifics of government policy,
and especially areas where I've been professionally involved)
will help me develop a coherent analytical framework that will make me better at my job.
Please do get in touch if you see anything here that you think isn't compatible with my public service role.

### Website details

I published some of the blog posts on here after a long delay, and in the process lost the original dates,
so some of the blog dates are approximate, or are complete guesses.
This means you should take it with a pinch of salt if I use any blog posts here as proof of prophetic foresight! ðŸ˜‰

The website is made using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
