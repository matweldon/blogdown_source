title: About Mat
---

I'm a Senior Data Scientist, working on Privacy Enhancing Technologies at the
[Data Science Campus](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk) 
([profile](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/author/mat-weldon)) 
of the UK [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/).
Prior to joining the ONS, I worked at the Department for Education as an Economic Adviser.

Before joining the civil service, 
I completed a PhD in statistics and conducted research in the economics of education at the University of Lancaster.
Before that, I worked for several years in administrative jobs in the private and public sectors.

I live in Morecambe with my family.

### Civil service code

As a civil servant, I take my responsibilities to comply with the
[Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code) 
seriously.
I endeavour not to express any opinions that would bring my integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality into doubt.
Please get in touch if you see anything here that you think isn't compatible with my public service role.
